While the Constitution of India envisions the UCC under Article 44, its implementation has remained a contentious issue, with strong arguments in both favour or against. But what exactly this Uniform Civil Code is and why is it becoming a hot topic of debate?\nWhat is Uniform Civil Code? All Indian people, regardless of their caste, religion, or tribe, are subject to the same set of rules known as the Uniform Civil Code, which regulates personal affairs including marriage, divorce, inheritance, adoption, and maintenance. The Hindu Marriage Act, the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat), the Christian Marriage Act, and other laws that are specific to a particular faith currently regulate these private affairs.\nThe idea behind the UCC is to replace these fragmented laws with one unified code that ensures equality, justice and national integration.\nConstitutional Basis of Uniform Civil Code Article 44 of Indian Constitution states: “The State shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a Uniform Civil Code throughout the territory of India.”\nIt is a part of Directive Principle of State Policy not enforceable but meant to guide the governance of the country towards certain ideals.\nWhy is the UCC important? Promotes Equality: Every citizen is treated equally under a unified legislation. It eliminates gender-based discrimination against women in personal legislation, particularly in areas such as inheritance and divorce.\nStrengthens National Integration: By providing one set of civil laws for all, it fosters a sense of unity among diverse communities.\nUpholds Secularism: India is a secular state, and laws should not be influenced by religious doctrine.\nSimplifies Legal Doctrine: Multiple personal laws cause misunderstandings and inconsistencies. A UCC would guarantee consistency in rulings and expedite the judicial process.\nChallenges and Criticisms Cultural Sensitivity: India has a rich religious heritage and is a varied nation. Many people think that enforcing a single code could violate their religious and cultural identities.\nFear of Majoritarianism: Minority populations frequently worry that the UCC is a covert attempt to force their habits to match those of the majority.\nAbsence of Political Consensus: Because of its delicate nature, successive administrations have been reluctant to carry out this constitutional purpose.\nPractical Challenges: It is a challenging undertaking to draft a code that is equitable and acceptable to all religious and cultural groups.\nRecent Development On 27 January 2025, Uttarakhand became the first state of India to implement the UCC by passing Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code Bill 2024.\nGoa was the first state that practiced a common civil code via The Portuguese Civil Code of 1867.\nAlso, Assam and Gujarat are the other two states who are working on the implementation of Uniform Civil Code.\nConclusion One of the most intricate and sensitive topics in Indian politics and culture is still the Uniform Civil Code. Its road is fraught with issues of identity, religion, and constitutional principles, despite its promises of equality and modernity. The secret is to take a progressive, comprehensive approach to law reform while striking a balance between individual rights and cultural liberties.\n***“समानो धर्मः सर्वेषां, समानं च न्यायदर्शनम्।*** एकता सदा राष्ट्रस्य, नैव भेदः संप्रदायतः॥”\n(Let the law be equal for all, Let justice have the same vision for all.\nUnity must always define the nation, Not division through faith or tradition.)\n"},{

  "content":"A Village Without Light: Pankaj’s Plea from Khirbi “We’re not asking for luxuries—just light, water, and a right to live.” — Pankaj, resident of Khirbi\nA Forgotten Corner in the Heart of Delhi While Delhi’s skyline grows higher and brighter, there exists a neglected locality within its heart—Khirbi, a village under the Delhi Cantonment Board. This community has been denied basic human needs for over 30 to 40 years.\nNo electricity. No clean water. No civic development. Just human survival—without dignity, without attention. The Voice of Khirbi — A Story from Pankaj When our team from Nyaypurti visited Khirbi, we met Pankaj, a young resident, educated and aware, yet helpless in the face of systemic silence.\n“Every election season, ministers come with promises—light, water, houses. We vote for them. Then they disappear. We’ve been living in darkness for decades.”\nIn the peak of Delhi’s unbearable heat, Khirbi’s people have no fans, no drinking water, and no pipeline. Children are forced to study under candlelight. The elderly suffer from heat strokes. And diseases spread unchecked.\nNow, there are even threats of demolition—with no plan for relocation, despite some residents having DDA flat tokens or documents.\nWhat Happened to Article 21? Article 21 of the Constitution of India guarantees the Right to Life with dignity.\nIs a life without electricity, without water, and without hope… still life?\nKhirbi raises urgent questions: Why have these people been denied basic civic infrastructure? Why are resettlement plans missing despite DDA involvement? Why demolish before offering alternative shelter? If three generations have lived here, how can they still be considered illegal?\nNyaypurti’s Stand We at Nyaypurti did not go there with political motives. We went there with legal awareness, with resolve. “We are not here to promise hope. We are here to show the path. The law is yours. Use it. Assert it.”\nOur goal is to: Empower residents with legal tools File RTIs and complaints Conduct awareness camps Explore public interest litigation Demand enforcement of their fundamental rights Our Appeal to the Authorities We appeal to: Delhi Cantonment Board Delhi Development Authority (DDA) Government of NCT of Delhi Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs If Khirbi has existed for 40 years, then its people exist as citizens—not as encroachers. You cannot erase decades of life overnight. You cannot talk about Smart Cities while parts of Delhi have no lights.\nThis Is Not Just About Khirbi This is not just Pankaj’s story. This is the story of hundreds of invisible communities—neglected by policy, ignored by the system.\nLet us remember: Shelter is not a privilege. It is a necessity. Electricity is not a favour. It is a basic need. Water is not a demand. It is a human right. "},{
